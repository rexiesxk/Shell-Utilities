1. [Splitter](https://github.com/rexiesxk/Shell-Utilities/tree/main/Splitter)

This python script splits huge text/csv files into smaller size as per user input.

The original text file and the script should be in the same directory. 

The output is redirected into a new directory, "splitfiles", and directory is created if not present.
